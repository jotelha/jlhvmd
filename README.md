# JlhVmd

Combines current development versions of

* TopoTools (git@github.com:akohlmey/topotools.git)
* PbcTools  (git@github.com:frobnitzem/pbctools.git)

as submodules as well as some own routines (jlhvmd).

*jlhvmd* requires tcllib (for yaml file support).
Tested with release 1.19 obtained at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib/files/tcllib/1.19/tcllib-1.19.zip

Follow 
https://gist.github.com/tonigi/a9cfaf7642a7fbc13293#file-install_vmd_plugin-md
to make these plugins available in VMD

One option to export this tree's location as well tcllib's path to 
the environment variable `$TCLLIBPATH` before launching *vmd*, i.e.:

    export TCLLIBPATH="${HOME}/opt/tcllib-1.19/lib/tcllib1.19"
    export TCLLIBPATH="${HOME}/git/jlhvmd/lib/plugins/noarch/tcl ${TCLLIBPATH}"
    vmd

## PbcTools

PbcTools requires building `libpbc_core.so`. On Ubuntu 18.04 
with `tcl8.5` and `tcl8.5-dev` installed via the apt package management,

These packages provide a configuration script


    source /usr/lib/tcl8.5/tclConfig.sh

that provides information sufficient to compile 

    lib/plugins/noarch/tcl/pbctools3.0/src/pbc_core.c

with

    g++ -shared -fPIC -o libpbc_core.so ${TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC} pbc_core.c ${TCL_LIB_SPEC} --verbose

without providing the VMD-specific includes as described on 
https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/doxygen/compiling.html

The resulting `libpbc_core.so` is to be placed at
`lib/plugins/noarch/tcl/pbctools3.0`.

## Notes

On Ubuntu, install `rlwrap` via `apt`. Afterwards, replace VMD's default *csh*
launcher (i.e. `/usr/local/bin/vmd`, file starts with shebang `#!/bin/csh`ï¼‰
with the `bash` alternative, usually available within VMD's binary distribution
as `bin/vmd.sh`. Make sure to adapt the paths in this bash launcher's header.
